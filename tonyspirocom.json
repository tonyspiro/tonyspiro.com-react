We took this project on in early 2015 and the challenge was to have the new site completed by the start of the new school year.  We had eight months from design to launch to have everything ready, without the possibility of pushing back on the deadline.  I'm happy to say that we met the deadline and all 300,000+ active and alumnae members now have a beautiful new website that loads fast and is much easier to use.\r\n\r\nThe new site consists of three main parts: 1. The public-facing marketing and story-telling pages 2. A private, login-only social network and 3. An e-commerce shop for picking up all sorts of Tri Delta swag and chapter essentials. \r\n\r\nFor the backend we used WordPress for the CMS, Woocommerce for the shop and a Node.js / MongoDB API for the user system. The front end uses Twitter Bootstrap and is fully responsive down to mobile.  All of the search functionality on the site (Global, Sister Search and Chapter Search) uses my React typeahead search which <a href=\"https://github.com/tonyspiro/react-typeahead-search\" target=\"_blank\">is available on GitHub</a>.\r\n\r\nAnother huge piece of the website is the Resources area.  To accommodate all of the files, links and custom documents necessary to communicate between the executive office, chapter members and officers, I built a React application that functions like a Google Drive for uploading chapter documents and linking to important off-site resources.  This all involved complex roles and permissions, tagging as well as drag and drop sorting.\r\n\r\nI'm very proud of the hard work that everyone at The Brand Hatchery and Tri Delta put in.  Now Tri Delta has something uniquely theres that uses the latest and best technology to connect all of their members and tell their story.\r\n\r\nYou can view the shiny new website at the following link:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.tridelta.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.tridelta.org</a>\r\n\r\nSome screenshots:\r\n<a href=\"http://tridelta.org\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://tonyspiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-29-at-5.50.18-PM.png\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://tridelta.org/shop\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://tonyspiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-30-at-1.05.30-AM.png\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://tridelta.org/shop\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://tonyspiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-30-at-1.02.03-AM.png\" /></a>","metafields":null,"type_slug":"work","created":"2015-10-04T07:42:05.616Z","user_id":"5357ef811693be2118000001","options":null,"order":null},{"_id":"56173431b48941c82c000007","slug":"social","title":"Social","content":"<p><br></p>","metafields":[{"edit":1,"value":"https://twitter.com/tonyspiro","key":"twitter","title":"Twitter","type":"text","children":false},{"edit":1,"value":"https://facebook.com/tonyspiro","key":"facebook","title":"Facebook","type":"text","children":false},{"edit":1,"value":"https://github.com/tonyspiro","key":"github","title":"Github","type":"text","children":false}],"bucket":"55ee2cb5286ef99908000004","type_slug":"globals","created":"2015-10-09T03:27:45.386Z","user_id":"5357ef811693be2118000001","options":{"slug_field":0,"content_editor":0,"add_metafields":0,"metafields_title":0,"metafields_key":0},"modified":"2015-10-19T04:58:50.510Z"},{"_id":"5610d84dc6fe7fd677000030","bucket":"55ee2cb5286ef99908000004","slug":"barnes-roberts","title":"Barnes and Roberts","content":"This is another website that was built on the WordPress platform over at <a href=\"http://brandhatchery.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Brand Hatchery</a>.  This one really came together nicely: It's responsive across all devices, cross-browser compatible and has some challenging functionality that was executed well (see the people page).\r\n\r\nCheck it out (warning: audio plays automatically (client request :)))\r\n<a href=\"http://www.brtrial.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\r\nhttp://www.brtrial.com\r\n</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.brtrial.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-763\" src=\"http://tonyspiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-16-at-7.39.11-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-06-16 at 7.39.11 PM\" /></a>","metafields":null,"type_slug":"work","created":"2015-10-04T07:42:05.615Z","user_id":"5357ef811693be2118000001","options":null,"order":null},{"_id":"5610d84dc6fe7fd67700002d","bucket":"55ee2cb5286ef99908000004","slug":"deep-ellum-search-company","title":"Deep Ellum Search Company","content":"This was another site that I helped hand-craft at <a href=\"http://brandhatchery.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Brand Hatchery</a>.

With <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/react/\" target=\"_blank\">React</a>, every piece of your application is controlled from a single source, it's owner.  The owner is defined by the Component that is passing \"props\" to its owned component.\r\n\r\nAs more nested components are added, this logic can grow out of hand and can make it difficult to keep track of events passed through the component hierarchy.  This is where <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/flux/\" target=\"_blank\">Flux</a> steps in to provide an outlet from the hierarchy to handle dispatched events and altered data within our application.\r\n\r\nRather than going into graphs and models to describe what Flux does, lets build an easy Flux example application.  We'll be building our application with the help of ES6 and Babel.  If you're unfamiliar with these, you can <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/\" target=\"_blank\">find out more about ES6 and Babel here</a>. Babel allows us to use both ES6 JavaScript and JSX which will both compile to ES5 JavaScript which is compatible across all modern and legacy browsers. Now let's get started...\r\n<h6>TL;DR</h6>\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/tonyspiro/easy-flux-example\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to download the full source code for this tutorial on GitHub</a>. Or keep reading if you want to follow along step-by-step.\r\n<h4>Getting started</h4>\r\nGet started by running the following commands in your preferred location:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">mkdir easy-flux-example\r\ncd easy-flux-example\r\n</pre>\r\nNow we need to add our dependencies. Normally you may just get a package.json file and hit npm install, but it's good for educational purposes to know exactly what you're adding to your project and why:\r\n(run these with one command):\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\r\nnpm install react babelify browserify flux lodash vinyl-source-stream events gulp gulp-uglify gulp-rename run-sequence\r\n</pre>\r\n(or one at a time):\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">npm install react // for react\r\nnpm install babelify // babel compiler\r\nnpm install browserify // node module loader\r\nnpm install flux // adds flux into the mix\r\nnpm install lodash // a great JS utility\r\nnpm install vinyl-source-stream // helps source our files for easy gulping\r\nnpm install events // node's event emitter\r\nnpm install gulp // our taskrunner to run compile / build processes\r\nnpm install gulp-uglify // compresses our bundle.js (2.7MB) to bundle.min.js (251K) a must!\r\nnpm install gulp-rename // renames our bundle.js file to bundle.min.js\r\nnpm install run-sequence // keeps our gulp processes in order\r\n</pre>\r\nNow that we've stocked our toolkit, let's build out our task runner. My preference is <a href=\"http://gulpjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gulp</a>, but you could just as easily use <a href=\"http://gruntjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Grunt</a> (though there are <a href=\"http://sixrevisions.com/web-development/grunt-vs-gulp/\" target=\"_blank\">legions of developers who would tell you Gulp is the better way</a>, myself included).\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">vim gulpfile.js\r\n</pre>\r\nAnd add the following:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\r\n// gulpfile.js\r\nvar gulp = require('gulp');\r\nvar browserify = require('browserify');\r\nvar babelify = require('babelify');\r\nvar source = require('vinyl-source-stream');\r\nvar uglify = require('gulp-uglify');\r\nvar rename = require('gulp-rename');\r\nvar runSequence = require('run-sequence');\r\n \r\ngulp.task('build', function () {\r\n  return browserify({\r\n    entries: 'app.js',\r\n    extensions: ['.jsx'],\r\n    debug: true\r\n  })\r\n  .transform(babelify)\r\n  .bundle()\r\n  .pipe(source('bundle.js'))\r\n  .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));\r\n});\r\n\r\ngulp.task('compress', function() {\r\n  return gulp.src('./dist/bundle.js')\r\n    .pipe(uglify())\r\n    .pipe(rename({suffix: '.min'}))\r\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));\r\n});\r\n\r\ngulp.task('default', function(cb) {\r\n  runSequence('build','compress', cb);\r\n});\r\n</pre>\r\nSo looking at this file you can see that the default build will use Browserify to grab all of our required modules and pipe them to Babel to be transformed into a bundle.js file and will end up in a folder called \"dist\". Pretty simple and straight-forward.\r\n\r\nNow that we have all of our processes ready to go, let's build our application (finally!).\r\n\r\nLet's start by creating index.html\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">vim index.html\r\n</pre>\r\nAdd the following to index.html:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\r\n&lt;head&gt;\r\n  &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt;\r\n  &lt;title&gt;Easy Flux Example&lt;/title&gt;\r\n&lt;/head&gt;\r\n&lt;body&gt;\r\n  &lt;h1&gt;Easy Flux Example&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n  &lt;div id=\"app-root\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n  &lt;script src=\"dist/bundle.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;</pre>\r\nAnd that's all we need for our frontend, everything else will be handled by React and Flux.\r\n\r\nLet's get started with our application logic by adding our main app file.\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">vim app.js\r\n</pre>\r\nAdd the following to app.js\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">// app.js\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport AppRoot from './components/AppRoot'; // we'll create this next\r\n\r\nReact.render(&lt;AppRoot /&gt;,\r\n  document.getElementById('app-root')\r\n);\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\nNotice all of the ES6 syntax which Babel will sort out into cross-compatible ES5 JavaScript. Also notice the importing of node modules, which Browserify will handle.\r\n\r\nNext, let's start building our Components, starting with AppRoot.\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">mkdir components\r\ncd components\r\nvim AppRoot.jsx\r\n</pre>\r\nAnd add the following:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">// AppRoot.jsx\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nclass AppRoot extends React.Component {\r\n    render(){\r\n        let itemHtml = &lt;li&gt;Hello React&lt;/li&gt;; // we will map a list here later\r\n        return &lt;div&gt;\r\n            &lt;ul&gt;\r\n                { itemHtml }\r\n            &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n         &lt;/div&gt;;\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n\r\nexport default AppRoot;\r\n</pre>\r\nNow let's take a step back and make sure all of this is working properly.\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">cd ../</pre>\r\nRun our gulp command which will convert our ES6 and JSX into ES5 (Babelify) and load everything into bundle.js (Browserify). If you haven't already, install gulp globally to use the CLI.\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">sudo npm install gulp -g</pre>\r\nThen run our build:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">gulp</pre>\r\nLet's check out what we have so far. You could easily just view index.html in your browser, but I like to view my apps on localhost. If you don't have http-server installed, run the following:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">sudo npm install http-server -g\r\nhttp-server</pre>\r\nNow go to <a href=\"http://localhost:8080\" target=\"_blank\">http://localhost:8080</a>. You should see a message which means that your React application is working.\r\n\r\nNow that React is working, let's add some interactivity, which is where Flux will work its magic.\r\n<h4>Adding Flux</h4>\r\nThe main pieces of the Flux architecture are the Components, Store and Dispatcher. Since we have our first Component set up, lets get started with our Store. Our Store will satisfy three pieces of our application. It will:\r\n\r\n1. Get initial data for our application.\r\n2. Store the functions for our application processes.\r\n3. Emit events that will tell our application to re-render our application.\r\n<h4>Reading data from the Store</h4>\r\nTo get our Store set up run the following commands:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">mkdir stores\r\ncd stores\r\nvim ListStore.js\r\n</pre>\r\nIn ListStore.js add the following:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">// ListStore.js\r\nimport {EventEmitter} from 'events';\r\nimport _ from 'lodash';\r\n\r\nlet ListStore = _.extend({}, EventEmitter.prototype, {\r\n\r\n  // Mock default data\r\n  items: [\r\n    {\r\n      name: 'Item 1',\r\n      id: 0\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      name: 'Item 2',\r\n      id: 1\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n\r\n  getItems: function(){\r\n    return this.items;\r\n  },\r\n\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport default ListStore;</pre>\r\nHere, we've added Node's EventEmmiter so our Store can emit events to trigger our UI changes. Lodash helps us bind the EventEmmiter to our ListStore object (you could also use other methods for this). And our mock data will be the default data visible on render. <code>getItems</code> is the obvious function that will get items from our Store.\r\n\r\nNext, let's add the new ListStore to our AppRoot Component so we can render our default Store data. Run the following commands:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">cd ../\r\ncd components\r\nvim AppRoot.jsx\r\n</pre>\r\nReplace the contents of AppRoot.jsx with the following:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">// AppRoot.jsx\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport ListStore from '../stores/ListStore';\r\n\r\n// Method to retrieve state from Stores\r\nlet getListState = () => {\r\n  return {\r\n    items: ListStore.getItems()\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass AppRoot extends React.Component {\r\n\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    super();\r\n    this.state = getListState();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render(){\r\n      \r\n    let items = ListStore.getItems();\r\n    \r\n    let itemHtml = items.map(( listItem ) =&gt; {\r\n\r\n      return &lt;li key={ listItem.id }&gt;\r\n          { listItem.name }\r\n        &lt;/li&gt;;\r\n\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    return &lt;div&gt;\r\n        &lt;ul&gt;\r\n            { itemHtml }\r\n        &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default AppRoot;\r\n</pre>\r\nNow run the following commands to rebuild our bundle.js:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">cd ../\r\ngulp\r\n</pre>\r\nNow run the following command:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">http-server\r\n</pre>\r\nAnd check out the changes at <a href=\"http://localhost:8080\" target=\"_blank\">http://localhost:8080</a>\r\n<h4>Adding / removing items in the Store</h4>\r\nNow let's add the ability to write new items to our Store. Let's create a new component that will handle this new functionality. Run the following commands:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">cd components\r\nvim NewItemForm.jsx\r\n</pre>\r\nAnd now add the following to NewItemForm.jsx:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">// NewItemForm.jsx\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport AppDispatcher from '../dispatcher/AppDispatcher';\r\n\r\nclass NewItemForm extends React.Component {\r\n\r\n  createItem(e){\r\n    \r\n    // so we don't reload the page\r\n    e.preventDefault();\r\n    \r\n    // create ID\r\n    let id = guid();\r\n    \r\n    // this gets the value from the input\r\n    let item_title = React.findDOMNode(this.refs.item_title).value.trim();\r\n    \r\n    // this removes the value from the input\r\n    React.findDOMNode(this.refs.item_title).value = '';\r\n    \r\n    // This is where the magic happens, \r\n    // no need to shoot this action all the way to the root of your application to edit state.\r\n    // AppDispatcher does this for you.\r\n    AppDispatcher.dispatch({\r\n      action: 'add-item',\r\n      new_item: {\r\n        id: id,\r\n        name: item_title\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render(){\r\n\r\n    return &lt;form onSubmit={ this.createItem.bind(this) }&gt;\r\n        &lt;input type=\"text\" ref=\"item_title\"/&gt;\r\n        &lt;button&gt;Add new item&lt;/button&gt;\r\n      &lt;/form&gt;;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction guid() {\r\n  function s4() {\r\n    return Math.floor((1 + Math.random()) * 0x10000)\r\n      .toString(16)\r\n      .substring(1);\r\n  }\r\n  return s4() + s4() + '-' + s4() + '-' + s4() + '-' +\r\n    s4() + '-' + s4() + s4() + s4();\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default NewItemForm;\r\n</pre>\r\nSo to give you a brief idea of what's happening here, from the render up: We're showing a text input that has the function <code>createItem</code> bound to it on submit. When the form is submitted, <code>createItem</code> will create the new id, clear the input, then pass the action ('add-item') and the <code>new_item</code> data to the AppDispatcher.\r\n\r\nNow we need to create our AppDispatcher to receive this data. Run the following commands:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">cd ../\r\nmkdir dispatcher\r\ncd dispatcher\r\nvim AppDispatcher.js\r\n</pre>\r\nAdd the following to AppDispatcher.js:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">// AppDispatcher.js \r\nimport {Dispatcher} from 'flux';\r\nlet AppDispatcher = new Dispatcher();\r\n\r\nimport ListStore from '../stores/ListStore';\r\n\r\n// Register callback with AppDispatcher\r\nAppDispatcher.register((payload) =&gt; {\r\n\r\n  let action = payload.action;\r\n  let new_item = payload.new_item;\r\n  let id = payload.id;\r\n\r\n  switch(action) {\r\n\r\n    // Respond to add-item action\r\n    case 'add-item':\r\n      ListStore.addItem(new_item);\r\n      break;\r\n    \r\n    // Respond to remove-item action\r\n    case 'remove-item':\r\n      ListStore.removeItem(id);\r\n      break;\r\n\r\n    default:\r\n      return true;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // If action was responded to, emit change event\r\n  ListStore.emitChange();\r\n\r\n  return true;\r\n\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport default AppDispatcher;\r\n</pre>\r\nThis is where Flux can get confusing, but with this simple example, I think it's pretty clear that when AppDispatcher is called we can perform our logic on its payload to determine what actions to take and what data to transmit. If the action is 'add-item' <code>ListStore.addItem</code> is triggered. If the action is 'remove-item' then <code>ListStore.removeItem</code> is triggered. Since these two functions don't exist in our Store yet, let's add them to our ListStore.\r\n\r\nRun the following commands:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">cd ../stores\r\nvim ListStore.js\r\n</pre>\r\nReplace the contents of ListStore.js with the following:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">// ListStore.js\r\nimport {EventEmitter} from 'events';\r\nimport _ from 'lodash';\r\n\r\nlet ListStore = _.extend({}, EventEmitter.prototype, {\r\n\r\n  // Mock default data\r\n  items: [\r\n    {\r\n      name: 'Item 1',\r\n      id: 0\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      name: 'Item 2',\r\n      id: 1\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n\r\n  // Get all items\r\n  getItems: function(){\r\n    return this.items;\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  // Add item\r\n  addItem: function(new_item){\r\n    this.items.push(new_item);\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  // Remove item\r\n  removeItem: function(item_id){\r\n    \r\n    let items = this.items;\r\n    \r\n    _.remove(items,(item) =&gt; {\r\n      return item_id == item.id;\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    this.items = items;\r\n\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  // Emit Change event\r\n  emitChange: function(){\r\n    this.emit('change');\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  // Add change listener\r\n  addChangeListener: function(callback){\r\n    this.on('change', callback);\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  // Remove change listener\r\n  removeChangeListener: function(callback){\r\n    this.removeListener('change', callback);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport default ListStore;\r\n</pre>\r\nNotice what we've added here: functions <code>addItem</code> and <code>deleteItem</code> add or remove items to <code>this.items</code>. <code>emitChange</code> causes an event to be emitted to our AppRoot Component with <code>_onChange</code> which will then render the new state from the ListStore.\r\n\r\nNow we need to edit our AppRoot Component to listen for the new events being triggered by the ListStore.\r\n\r\nRun the following commands:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">cd ../components\r\nvim AppRoot.jsx\r\n</pre>\r\nAnd now we'll replace the contents of AppRoot with the following:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">// AppRoot.jsx\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport ListStore from '../stores/ListStore';\r\nimport AppDispatcher from '../dispatcher/AppDispatcher';\r\n\r\n// Sub components\r\nimport NewItemForm from './NewItemForm';\r\n\r\n// Method to retrieve state from Stores\r\nlet getListState = () =&gt; {\r\n  return {\r\n    items: ListStore.getItems()\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass AppRoot extends React.Component {\r\n  \r\n  // Method to setState based upon Store changes\r\n  _onChange() {\r\n    this.setState(getListState());\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    super();\r\n    this.state = getListState();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // Add change listeners to stores\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    ListStore.addChangeListener(this._onChange.bind(this));\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // Remove change listeners from stores\r\n  componentWillUnmount() {\r\n    ListStore.removeChangeListener(this._onChange.bind(this));\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  removeItem(e){\r\n\r\n    let id = e.target.dataset.id;\r\n    \r\n    AppDispatcher.dispatch({\r\n      action: 'remove-item',\r\n      id: id\r\n    });\r\n\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render(){\r\n      \r\n    let _this = this;\r\n    let items = ListStore.getItems();\r\n    let itemHtml = items.map(( listItem ) =&gt; {\r\n      return &lt;li key={ listItem.id }&gt;\r\n          { listItem.name } &lt;button onClick={ _this.removeItem } data-id={ listItem.id }&gt;×&lt;/button&gt;\r\n        &lt;/li&gt;;\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    return &lt;div&gt;\r\n        &lt;ul&gt;\r\n            { itemHtml }\r\n        &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n        &lt;NewItemForm /&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default AppRoot;\r\n</pre>\r\nNotice what we've added here: <code>_onChange</code> handles all state changes within our Flux app. And notice that we have the function <code>removeItem</code> which calls the AppDispatcher with the \"remove-item\" action.\r\n\r\nNow let's see if it's working as it should. Run the following commands to build the bundle.js with our updates.\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">cd ../\r\ngulp\r\n</pre>\r\nAnd when gulp is done, run:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">http-server\r\n</pre>\r\nNow go to <a href=\"http://localhost:8080\" target=\"_blank\">http://localhost:8080</a> and you should be able to add and remove items from our easy Flux example application.\r\n\r\nI hope you found this tutorial helpful in understanding the powerful concepts behind building interactive apps with React and Flux.

I love using <a href=\"http://gruntjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Grunt</a> to streamline and organize my development workflow.  I use it to Uglify my JS, modularize my LESS files, preprocess my CSS and more. I thought why not cut out that extra task of configuring and restarting MAMP?  So I looked around for a way to easily do this and couldn't find one.  So what does a resourceful developer do?\r\n\r\nSo I decided to build it myself and here's what I've come up with: a node module called <a href=\"https://github.com/tonyspiro/grunt-mamp\">Grunt MAMP</a>.\r\n\r\nHere's how it works:\r\n\r\ncd into your project root and run:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\r\nnpm install grunt\r\nnpm install grunt-mamp\r\n</pre>\r\nCreate your Gruntfile.js from the example shown on the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-mamp\" target=\"_blank\">Grunt MAMP npmjs.org page</a>:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\r\n\"use strict\";\r\n \r\nmodule.exports = function(grunt){\r\n \r\n  /* !!!! CONFIGURE !!!!\r\n  ====================================================  */\r\n  var site_full_path = '/your/full/site/path'; // something like /Users/username/sites/mymampsite \r\n  var port = 8888;\r\n \r\n  /* Init\r\n  ====================================================  */\r\n  grunt.initConfig({\r\n \r\n    mamp : {\r\n      \r\n      configserver : {\r\n        options : {\r\n          site_full_path : site_full_path,\r\n          port : port\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n \r\n      startserver : {\r\n        options : {\r\n          site_full_path : site_full_path,\r\n          port : port\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      \r\n      stopserver : {\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n \r\n  });\r\n \r\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-mamp');\r\n \r\n  // Register tasks  \r\n  grunt.registerTask(\"start\", [\"mamp:startserver\"]);\r\n  grunt.registerTask(\"stop\", [\"mamp:stopserver\"]);\r\n  grunt.registerTask(\"config\", [\"mamp:configserver\"]);\r\n \r\n};\r\n</pre>\r\nNext, configure your settings to point to your desired path and port.  Then run the following commands:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\r\ngrunt configure\r\ngrunt start\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nWhen you want to shutdown MAMP, just run:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\r\ngrunt stop\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nNow you can configure, start and stop from the terminal!  This makes it so you don't have to go back to your MAMP Application and reconfigure when switching between projects and it's one less thing you have to do in your workflow.\r\n\r\nFind the source code on <a href=\"https://github.com/tonyspiro/grunt-mamp\" target=\"_blank\">github</a> or <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-mamp\" target=\"_blank\">npm</a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>One important note</strong>: The config command will replace your MAMP httpd.conf file with the template provided in Grunt MAMP (which is the latest httpd.conf file that ships with MAMP 3.0.6).  If you have any custom configurations for this file, make sure to create a backup and add the appropriate variables to this file to create your own custom Grunt MAMP httpd.conf template.\r\n\r\nIf you have any question or comments, use the comment form below or you can find me on twitter:\r\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/tonyspiro\" target=\"_blank\">@tonyspiro</a>.","metafields":null,"type_slug":"post","created":"2015-10-04T07:42:05.608Z","user_id":"5357ef811693be2118000001","options":null,"order":3},{"_id":"5610d84dc6fe7fd677000025","bucket":"55ee2cb5286ef99908000004","slug":"getting-started-with-grunt-js-html5-boilerplate","title":"Getting Started With The Grunt.js Twitter Bootstrap HTML5 Boilerplate","content":"<a href=\"https://github.com/tonyspiro/grunt-html5-boilerplate\" target=\"_blank\">Download the repo on github here</a>.\r\n\r\nI'm always looking for ways to streamline and organize my front end workflow and I've found great success in using LESS to organize my CSS and Grunt.js to automate my compiling and minifying tasks and I'd like to share a new starter project that will help you use these tools to your advantage.\r\n\r\nI love the <a href=\"http://www.initializr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Initializer project</a> which provides a robust boilerplate by including the latest Twitter Bootstrap, JQuery, Modernizer, and Google Analytics code. I thought why not incorporate this great boilerplate with Grunt.js to streamline  my workflow to keep my code base more organized, easier to manage, easy to scale and make page load times MUCH faster. And we all know the studies that prove even a fraction of a second faster page load time improves the bottom line. Just ask <a href=\"http://blog.gigaspaces.com/amazon-found-every-100ms-of-latency-cost-them-1-in-sales/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>.\r\n\r\nSo lets get started in building out our Grunt.js HTML5 Boilerplate project!\r\n\r\nHead over to the Github repo for <a href=\"https://github.com/tonyspiro/grunt-html5-boilerplate\" target=\"_blank\">Grunt.js HTML5 Boilerplate</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/tonyspiro/grunt-html5-boilerplate/archive/master.zip\" target=\"_blank\">download the zip</a>.\r\n\r\nAfter unpacking it's contents, head to your Terminal and cd into the folder:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">cd grunt-html5-boilerplate-master</pre>\r\nRun this next command only if you do not have Grunt.js installed on your machine:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">npm install -g grunt-cli</pre>\r\nAfter grunt is installed globally on your machine you can then begin using Grunt HTML5 Boilerplate.  Run the following command to run grunt only once:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">grunt</pre>\r\nYou'll notice in your terminal, you may see pretty green and blue lights and happy messages like:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">Running \"less:production\" (less) task</pre>\r\nand\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">Done, without errors.</pre>\r\nThis means that grunt is working and you now have a beautiful Bootstrap enabled index.html with just ONE MINIFIED CSS FILE and ONE MINIFIED JAVASCRIPT FILE.\r\n\r\nYou can also have Grunt.js watch your files for edits and process them on the fly. Just run this command, make your edits and Grunt.js will process and compile your changes.\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">grunt watch</pre>\r\nHopefully you found this helpful and will try Grunt.js Initilizer on your next web project.  I think you'll find it will help your project to become more organized, scalable and have faster page load times once deployed live.\r\n\r\nHit me up here in the comments or on Twitter if you have any questions or thoughts: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tonyspiro\" target=\"_blank\">@tonyspiro</a>","metafields":null,"type_slug":"post","created":"2015-10-04T07:42:05.608Z","user_id":"5357ef811693be2118000001","options":null,"order":4},{"_id":"5610d84dc6fe7fd677000006","bucket":"55ee2cb5286ef99908000004","slug":"about","title":"About","content":"Hi, I'm Tony Spiro.\r\n\r\nI’m a web developer with years of experience building websites and applications on the LAMP stack.

Please see the updated version <a href=\"http://tonyspiro.com/uploading-resizing-images-fly-node-js-express/\">Uploading and Resizing Images (on the fly) With Node.js and Express</a>.\r\n\r\nNode.js is an awesome development platform that lets you build web applications with server-side javascript.  In this example I'll show you how to build a simple application that will allow you to upload a file to a server in a full size and thumbnail size format.\r\n\r\nFirst you need to have node installed on your machine.  <a href=\"http://nodejs.org\" target=\"_blank\">Visit the node.js website</a> for instructions on how to do this.\r\n\r\nUsing your preferred terminal application, cd to the preferred location of your application and create your application folder:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">mkdir uploadapp</pre>\r\nThen navigate into this folder:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">cd uploadapp</pre>\r\nNext let's install the express.js framework. This is easily done with the following command from your app's folder:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">npm install express</pre>\r\nNow that we have our webframework, lets setup our server.\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">nano app.js</pre>\r\nAdd the following to app.js:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">var express = require(\"express\");\r\nvar app = express();\r\n\r\napp.get('/', function (req, res){\r\n\tres.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });\r\n\tres.end(\"Hello World!\");\r\n\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.listen(8080);</pre>\r\nNext inside your terminal start node on the app.js file:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">node app.js</pre>\r\nAnd go to http://localhost:8080 and you should see the following:\r\n<pre>Hello World!</pre>\r\nNow that we have our server working, let's build our uploader app. Replace the text in app.js with the following:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">var express = require(\"express\");\r\nvar app = express();\r\n\r\nvar form = \"&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;\" +\r\n\"&lt;form method='post' action='/upload' enctype='multipart/form-data'&gt;\" +\r\n\"&lt;input type='file' name='image'/&gt;\" +\r\n\"&lt;input type='submit' /&gt;&lt;/form&gt;\" +\r\n\"&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\";\r\n\r\napp.get('/', function (req, res){\r\n\tres.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html' });\r\n\tres.end(form);\t\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.listen(8080);</pre>\r\nNotice that now we have an upload form that will post the file to http://localhost:8080/upload. Let's create the folders where we want our images to go.\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">mkdir uploads\r\ncd uploads\r\nmkdir fullsize\r\nmkdir thumbs\r\ncd ../</pre>\r\nSo now we have the folder uploads that contains the folders fullsize and thumbs to contain our different image sizes. Now let's add the upload handling page, edit app.js to the look like the following:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">var express = require(\"express\");\r\nvar app = express();\r\n\r\n/// Include the express body parser\r\napp.configure(function () {\r\n  app.use(express.bodyParser());\r\n});\r\n\r\nvar form = \"&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;\" +\r\n\"&lt;form method='post' action='/upload' enctype='multipart/form-data'&gt;\" +\r\n\"&lt;input type='file' name='image'/&gt;\" +\r\n\"&lt;input type='submit' /&gt;&lt;/form&gt;\" +\r\n\"&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\";\r\n\r\napp.get('/', function (req, res){\r\n\tres.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html' });\r\n\tres.end(form);\r\n\r\n});\r\n\r\n/// Include the node file module\r\nvar fs = require('fs');\r\n\r\n/// Post files\r\napp.post('/upload', function(req, res) {\r\n\r\n\tfs.readFile(req.files.image.path, function (err, data) {\r\n\r\n\t\tvar imageName = req.files.image.name\r\n\r\n\t\t/// If there's an error\r\n\t\tif(!imageName){\r\n\r\n\t\t\tconsole.log(\"There was an error\")\r\n\t\t\tres.redirect(\"/\");\r\n\t\t\tres.end();\r\n\r\n\t\t} else {\r\n\r\n\t\t  var newPath = __dirname + \"/uploads/fullsize/\" + imageName;\r\n\r\n\t\t  /// write file to uploads/fullsize folder\r\n\t\t  fs.writeFile(newPath, data, function (err) {\r\n\r\n\t\t  \t/// let's see it\r\n\t\t  \tres.redirect(\"/uploads/fullsize/\" + imageName);\r\n\r\n\t\t  });\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t});\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.listen(8080);</pre>\r\nAfter we upload our file we want to be able to see it, so let's add a route to view our file.\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">/// Show files\r\napp.get('/uploads/fullsize/:file', function (req, res){\r\n\tfile = req.params.file;\r\n\tvar img = fs.readFileSync(__dirname + \"/uploads/fullsize/\" + file);\r\n\tres.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'image/jpg' });\r\n\tres.end(img, 'binary');\r\n\r\n});</pre>\r\nNow the full app.js file should look like this:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">var app = express();\r\n\r\n/// Include the express body parser\r\napp.configure(function () {\r\n  app.use(express.bodyParser());\r\n});\r\n\r\nvar form = \"&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;\" +\r\n\"&lt;form method='post' action='/upload' enctype='multipart/form-data'&gt;\" +\r\n\"&lt;input type='file' name='image'/&gt;\" +\r\n\"&lt;input type='submit' /&gt;&lt;/form&gt;\" +\r\n\"&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\";\r\n\r\napp.get('/', function (req, res){\r\n\tres.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html' });\r\n\tres.end(form);\r\n\r\n});\r\n\r\n/// Include the node file module\r\nvar fs = require('fs');\r\n\r\n/// Post files\r\napp.post('/upload', function(req, res) {\r\n\r\n\tfs.readFile(req.files.image.path, function (err, data) {\r\n\r\n\t\tvar imageName = req.files.image.name\r\n\r\n\t\t/// If there's an error\r\n\t\tif(!imageName){\r\n\r\n\t\t\tconsole.log(\"There was an error\")\r\n\t\t\tres.redirect(\"/\");\r\n\t\t\tres.end();\r\n\r\n\t\t} else {\r\n\r\n\t\t  var newPath = __dirname + \"/uploads/fullsize/\" + imageName;\r\n\r\n\t\t  /// write file to uploads/fullsize folder\r\n\t\t  fs.writeFile(newPath, data, function (err) {\r\n\r\n\t\t  \t/// let's see it\r\n\t\t  \tres.redirect(\"/uploads/fullsize/\" + imageName);\r\n\r\n\t\t  });\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t});\r\n});\r\n\r\n/// Show files\r\napp.get('/uploads/fullsize/:file', function (req, res){\r\n\tfile = req.params.file;\r\n\tvar img = fs.readFileSync(__dirname + \"/uploads/fullsize/\" + file);\r\n\tres.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'image/jpg' });\r\n\tres.end(img, 'binary');\r\n\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.listen(8080);\r\n</pre>\r\nLet's upload a file and see if this works. Restart node on app.js and navigate to http://localhost:8080. Upload a file and you should be redirected to see your fullsize image. Now let's create the thumbnail version of this file. First we need to add a new module to our node stack to handle the resize. In your terminal at your app's root download the Image Magick package:\r\n<pre>npm install imagemagick</pre>\r\nNow edit app.js to look like this:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">var express = require(\"express\");\r\nvar app = express();\r\n\r\n/// Include the express body parser\r\napp.configure(function () {\r\n  app.use(express.bodyParser());\r\n});\r\n\r\nvar form = \"&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;\" +\r\n\"&lt;form method='post' action='/upload' enctype='multipart/form-data'&gt;\" +\r\n\"&lt;input type='file' name='image'/&gt;\" +\r\n\"&lt;input type='submit' /&gt;&lt;/form&gt;\" +\r\n\"&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\";\r\n\r\napp.get('/', function (req, res){\r\n\tres.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html' });\r\n\tres.end(form);\r\n\r\n});\r\n\r\n/// Include the node file module\r\nvar fs = require('fs');\r\n\r\n/// Include ImageMagick\r\nvar im = require('imagemagick');\r\n\r\n/// Post files\r\napp.post('/upload', function(req, res) {\r\n\r\n\tfs.readFile(req.files.image.path, function (err, data) {\r\n\r\n\t\tvar imageName = req.files.image.name\r\n\r\n\t\t/// If there's an error\r\n\t\tif(!imageName){\r\n\r\n\t\t\tconsole.log(\"There was an error\")\r\n\t\t\tres.redirect(\"/\");\r\n\t\t\tres.end();\r\n\r\n\t\t} else {\r\n\r\n\t\t   var newPath = __dirname + \"/uploads/fullsize/\" + imageName;\r\n\r\n\t\t  var thumbPath = __dirname + \"/uploads/thumbs/\" + imageName;\r\n\r\n\t\t  /// write file to uploads/fullsize folder\r\n\t\t  fs.writeFile(newPath, data, function (err) {\r\n\r\n\t\t  \t/// write file to uploads/thumbs folder\r\n\t\t\t  im.resize({\r\n\t\t\t\t  srcPath: newPath,\r\n\t\t\t\t  dstPath: thumbPath,\r\n\t\t\t\t  width:   200\r\n\t\t\t\t}, function(err, stdout, stderr){\r\n\t\t\t\t  if (err) throw err;\r\n\t\t\t\t  console.log('resized image to fit within 200x200px');\r\n\t\t\t\t});\r\n\r\n\t\t\t   res.redirect(\"/uploads/fullsize/\" + imageName);\r\n\r\n\t\t  });\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t});\r\n});\r\n\r\n/// Show files\r\napp.get('/uploads/fullsize/:file', function (req, res){\r\n\tfile = req.params.file;\r\n\tvar img = fs.readFileSync(__dirname + \"/uploads/fullsize/\" + file);\r\n\tres.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'image/jpg' });\r\n\tres.end(img, 'binary');\r\n\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.get('/uploads/thumbs/:file', function (req, res){\r\n\tfile = req.params.file;\r\n\tvar img = fs.readFileSync(__dirname + \"/uploads/thumbs/\" + file);\r\n\tres.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'image/jpg' });\r\n\tres.end(img, 'binary');\r\n\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.listen(8080);</pre>\r\nIf you get an error trying to use Image Magick, it may need to be installed on your machine. On a mac you can run the following command to install via brew:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">brew install imagemagick</pre>\r\nGo to http://localhost:8080 and you should now be able to upload two different versions of the file, fullsize and thumb located at:\r\n\r\nhttp://localhost:8080/uploads/fullsize/youruploadedfile\r\nhttp://localhost:8080/uploads/thumbs/youruploadedfile\r\n\r\nI hope you found this helpful.

Express no longer supports the bodyParser method, and I've found a new way to resize images on the fly with the Quickthumb node module. Using this package for image resizing is super easy and useful. To upload images using Node.js and Express, I've enlisted the help of the Formidable module.\r\n\r\nSo lets get started in creating our image upload application using Node.js, Express, Formidable and Quickthumb.\r\n\r\nFirst, make sure you have Node.js installed. Visit the <a href=\"http://nodejs.org\" target=\"_blank\">node.js</a> website for instructions on how to do this.\r\n\r\nUsing your preferred terminal application, cd to the preferred location of your application and create your application folder:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">mkdir uploadapp</pre>\r\nThen navigate into this folder:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">cd uploadapp</pre>\r\nNext let's install all of our dependent packages. We'll be installing the Express.js framework, Formidable, Quickthumb and Fs-extra. Run the following commands:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">npm install express\r\nnpm install formidable\r\nnpm install quickthumb\r\nnpm install fs-extra\r\n</pre>\r\nNow that we have our webframework and dependencies, lets setup our server.\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">vim app.js</pre>\r\nAdd the following to app.js:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">var express = require(\"express\"),\r\n    app = express(),\r\n    formidable = require('formidable'),\r\n    util = require('util'),\r\n    fs   = require('fs-extra'),\r\n    qt   = require('quickthumb');\r\n\r\n// Use quickthumb\r\napp.use(qt.static(__dirname + '/'));\r\n\r\napp.post('/upload', function (req, res){\r\n  var form = new formidable.IncomingForm();\r\n  form.parse(req, function(err, fields, files) {\r\n    res.writeHead(200, {'content-type': 'text/plain'});\r\n    res.write('received upload:\\n\\n');\r\n    res.end(util.inspect({fields: fields, files: files}));\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  form.on('end', function(fields, files) {\r\n    /* Temporary location of our uploaded file */\r\n    var temp_path = this.openedFiles[0].path;\r\n    /* The file name of the uploaded file */\r\n    var file_name = this.openedFiles[0].name;\r\n    /* Location where we want to copy the uploaded file */\r\n    var new_location = 'uploads/';\r\n\r\n    fs.copy(temp_path, new_location + file_name, function(err) {  \r\n      if (err) {\r\n        console.error(err);\r\n      } else {\r\n        console.log(\"success!\")\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Show the upload form\t\r\napp.get('/', function (req, res){\r\n  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html' });\r\n  var form = '&lt;form action=\"/upload\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\" method=\"post\"&gt;Add a title: &lt;input name=\"title\" type=\"text\" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;input multiple=\"multiple\" name=\"upload\" type=\"file\" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Upload\" /&gt;&lt;/form&gt;';\r\n  res.end(form); \r\n}); \r\napp.listen(8080);\r\n</pre>\r\nNext inside your terminal start node on the app.js file:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">node app.js</pre>\r\n\r\nNext, go to http://localhost:8080 and you should now see your form with an input field, a title field and a browse file field. With this, you can pass whatever data you want along with your file, such as a new title, user info, etc. Upload a file and notice it takes you to http://localhost:8080/upload where all of your upload information is available.  You would probably want to setup a redirect or upload the file / data through ajax, but this shows you what data is being passed. \r\n\r\nNext go to:\r\n\r\nhttp://localhost:8080/uploads/your-uploaded-file-name\r\n\r\nYou should now see your fullsize uploaded file. Now here comes the fun part. To resize your image on the fly, just add the paramater 'dim' at the end of your url:\r\n\r\nhttp://localhost:8080/uploads/your-uploaded-file-name?dim=200\r\n\r\nYour image will now display at 200 pixels wide and adjust the height proportionately. You can also customize the dim value to reflect the desired width and height of your image. For more options, check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/zivester/node-quickthumb\" target=\"_blank\">quickthumb node module on github</a>.\r\n\r\nNote: Quick Thumb requires Image Magick. If you get an error trying to upload the image, Image Magick may need to be installed on your machine. On a mac you can run the following command to install via brew:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">brew install imagemagick</pre>\r\nI hope you found this helpful.

Now I like Grunt, but I've realized I like writing code better than configuring processes and with Gulp, I have more freedom to write processes easily.  \r\n\r\nOther reasons why I choose Gulp over Grunt: I prefer the concept of streaming the files through alterations instead of writing a new file every time I need to complete a specific task, <a href=\"http://jaysoo.ca/2014/01/27/gruntjs-vs-gulpjs/\" target=\"_blank\">it's more concise and I've found it easier and faster to do the job</a>.

And we know as developers, every minute counts in the course of our day. So I built a gulp plugin that will configure, start and stop MAMP from a few gulp commands.\r\n\r\nIn your project location, just run the following command to install gulp-mamp:\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">npm install gulp-mamp</pre>\r\n\r\nOnce this is in your node_modules folder, you can configure your dev environment and add the gulp-mamp tasks to your gulpfile.js:\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\r\nvar options = {};\r\noptions.user = 'yourusername';\r\noptions.port = 8888;\r\noptions.site_path = '/your/full/site/path'; // something like /Users/username/sites/mymampsite  \r\n \r\n// Modules \r\nvar gulp = require('gulp');\r\nvar mamp = require('gulp-mamp');\r\n \r\ngulp.task('config', function(cb){\r\n    mamp(options, 'config', cb);\r\n});\r\n \r\ngulp.task('start', function(cb){\r\n    mamp(options, 'start', cb);\r\n});\r\n \r\ngulp.task('stop', function(cb){\r\n    mamp(options, 'stop', cb);\r\n});\r\n \r\ngulp.task('mamp', ['config', 'start']);\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nAfter these have been added, you can now run the following commands to configure, start and stop MAMP from your gulpfile.\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\r\ngulp mamp\r\ngulp stop\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nWatch this repo on github:\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/tonyspiro/gulp-mamp\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/tonyspiro/gulp-mamp</a>\r\n\r\nAnd npm:\r\n<a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-mamp/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-mamp/</a>\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions in the comments below.","metafields":null,"type_slug":"post","created":"2015-10-04T07:42:05.609Z","user_id":"5357ef811693be2118000001","options":null,"order":14},{"_id":"5610d84dc6fe7fd677000015","bucket":"55ee2cb5286ef99908000004","slug":"tslider-a-lightweight-and-easy-image-slider","title":"TSlider: A Light-Weight and Easy-To-Implement  Image Slider","content":"View the demo <a href='http://dev.tonyspiro.com/tslider' target='_blank'>here</a>.\r\n\r\nIt seems like if you do an image slider / slideshow search online, everyone and their dog has one available.

It is also available on <a href=\"https://github.com/tonyspiro\">my github page</a>.\r\n\r\nSo just a little bit about how this works...\r\n\r\nHere's the markup:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">&lt;!doctype html&gt;\r\n&lt;html&gt;\r\n&lt;head&gt;\r\n    &lt;title&gt;TSlider&lt;/title&gt;\r\n    &lt;script src=\"http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;link type='text/css' rel='stylesheet' href='style.css' /&gt;\r\n&lt;/head&gt;\r\n&lt;body&gt;\r\n&lt;div class='container'&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class='slider-viewport'&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class='slider-frame'&gt;\r\n            &lt;div class='slide'&gt;\r\n                &lt;img src='images/drums/1.jpg' /&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n            &lt;div class='slide'&gt;\r\n                &lt;img src='images/drums/2.jpg' /&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n            &lt;div class='slide'&gt;\r\n                &lt;img src='images/drums/3.jpg' /&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n            &lt;div class='slide'&gt;\r\n                &lt;img src='images/drums/4.jpg' /&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class='nav right'&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class='left point' id='sliderPrev'&gt;Prev&lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class='right point' id='sliderNext'&gt;Next&lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;script src=\"js/tslider.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;</pre>\r\n\r\nAnd the tslider.js file:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\r\n$(document).ready(function() {\r\n\t\r\n\t////////////////////////////////////////////////////\t\r\n\t////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\n\t////////////\t\t\t\t////////////\r\n\t////////////\t\tSlider Init\t////////////\r\n\t////////////\t\t\t\t////////////\r\n\t////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\n\t////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t/// Set your variables\r\n\tvar numSlides = $(\".slide\").length;\r\n\tvar slideWidth = $(\".slide\").width();\r\n\t\r\n\t/// Start the show!\r\n\tvar onSlide = 1;\r\n\t\r\n\tgoToSlide(onSlide, slideWidth);\r\n\t\r\n\tvar num = 1;\r\n\t$(\".slide\").each(function(){\r\n\t\t$(this).attr(\"id\", 'slide' + num);\r\n\t\tnum++;\r\n\t});\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tvar turnedOff = false;\r\n\t//// Auto slide?

So when you scroll from the first slide to the last, you see it move, then BOOM you're taken to the REAL last slide so fast you don't even know it. The same goes for the effect when you're on the last slide... it shows the first slide coming at you then WHAM you get taken to the first slide (which is actually the 2nd slide). Pretty cool right? (Esp with the sound effects).\r\n\r\nAnother little thing that I hear requested a lot is the auto slide. But how annoying is it when you try to control the slider and it goes to the next slide! Gah! It makes you want to shout at the slide show, but fret no more. With TSlider as soon as you take control of the slider, the auto slide stops and you the user have full control.\r\n\r\nSo there you have it, an easy and lightweight image slider.","metafields":null,"type_slug":"post","created":"2015-10-04T07:42:05.572Z","user_id":"5357ef811693be2118000001","options":null,"order":15},{"_id":"5610d84dc6fe7fd677000010","bucket":"55ee2cb5286ef99908000004","slug":"spyrock-relaunched-finally","title":"Spyrock Relaunched (Finally!)","content":"After about 6 months of coding on and off (which is def not the best way to maintain consistent code) I've finally relaunched my local music web app <a href='http://www.thespyrock.com'>Spyrock</a>.\r\n\r\nIt's not that it's done, it's that it's done enough.  Kind of like a song or album that the artist knows could be better, but they'll be much happier letting it go than tweaking and tinkering for another minute.  Of course I'm not going to stop tinkering and improving the site, but at least now this is a better representation of my current coding practice.  I launched this app about two years ago and as with everything and everyone, two years changes a lot of things...  which brings me to the idea for the this post.\r\n\r\nFirst of which, two years ago HTML5 was not as popular of a coding practice as browser support was not quite up to par.  And in that time another awesome development, <a href='http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/' target='_blank'>Bootstrap</a> became available.  And as you will see I made full use of this excellent HTML/CSS/Jquery framework in Spyrock's redesign / relaunch.  \r\n\r\nSo the inspiration behind this post is to let you know an interesting plugin that I found to solve a very important issue around using HTML attributes with form fields.  Adding the \"placeholder\" attribute will only be seen by modern browsers that can handle HTML5.  Well that makes it kind of tough for a lot of users who haven't updated their browser trying to read what to do in the form fields.  So I'm going to share a really cool plugin that I found to solve this present issue:\r\n\r\nCheck out: <a href='https://github.com/jamesallardice/Placeholders.js' target='_blank'>Placeholders.js</a>.  This is a great way to solve this problem because it's SO EASY.  Check it out, this is all you have to add to your awesome HTML pages that you want to display correctly in legacy browsers:\r\n\r\n<pre class='prettyprint'>&lt;script src=\"placeholders.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;script&gt;\r\n$(document).ready(function(){\r\n\tPlaceholders.init();\r\n});\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nAnd there you go!  Welcome to the modern age.  Now go visit <a href='http://www.thespyrock.com/'>http://www.thespyrock.com/</a> dust off that old browser and check it out in action.  And catch some local shows while you're at it!","metafields":null,"type_slug":"post","created":"2015-10-04T07:42:05.567Z","user_id":"5357ef811693be2118000001","options":null,"order":16},{"_id":"5610d84dc6fe7fd677000017","bucket":"55ee2cb5286ef99908000004","slug":"php-function-that-uploads-a-file-to-rackspace-cloud-files-container-using-the-open-cloud-api","title":"PHP Function That Uploads A File To Rackspace Cloud Files Container Using The Open Cloud API","content":"It seems like there is a lot of documentation on Rackspace's old API for uploading to Cloud Files, but not a lot of documentation on how to use the new PHP Open Cloud API for Rackspace Cloud Files.

Stores the data in memcached for future use, thus limiting the call to the database and promoting faster and more reliable performance.  \r\n\r\nWell this php class does just that in a memcached enabled environment (it even checks to make sure memcached is available!).  \r\n\r\nOk let's do this.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have Memcached enabled on your server.  To check this, just run the script:\r\n\r\n<pre class='prettyprint'>\r\n&lt;?php\r\n/* \r\nYou are actually checking for Memcache\r\nCare to find out more on why this is, you can check out this forum post: http://serverfault.com/questions/63383/memcache-vs-memcached\r\n*/\r\n\r\nif(class_exists('Memcache')){\r\n  // Memcache is enabled.\r\n  echo \"Sure is Bob\";\r\n} else {\r\n   echo \"No way Jose\";\r\n}\r\n?&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nIf you don't have it installed, there are lots of articles out there that will help you install it on your particular machine.

Full Version\r\n\r\nThis creates a \"blurr\" to \"in focus\" effect which is a better alternative than longer loading times and visually loading down a large image.\r\n\r\nPlus, it will serve the correct image size to the user based on their browser size, thus eliminating unnecessarily large images and slow loading for mobile devices.\r\n\r\nEasy to use:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">&lt;html&gt;\r\n&lt;head&gt;\r\n&lt;/head&gt;\r\n&lt;body&gt;\r\n&lt;img class=\"dynamic-image\" src=\"http://tonyspiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gretch-500x500.jpg\" img-mobile=\"http://tonyspiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gretch-500x500.jpg\" img-tablet=\"http://tonyspiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gretch-1000x1000.jpg\" img-full=\"http://tonyspiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gretch.jpg\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;script src='//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;script src='dynamic-image.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;script&gt;\r\n$(function(){\r\n$(\".dynamic-image\").dynamicImage();\r\n});\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;</pre>\r\nUnder the hood of dynamic-image.js:\r\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">(function( $ ) {\r\n\r\n    $.fn.dynamicImage = function() {\r\n\r\n\t\tvar num = 0;\r\n\r\n        return this.each(function(){\r\n\r\n            var windowWidth = $(window).width();\r\n\r\n\t\t\tvar imgFull = $(this).attr(\"img-full\");\r\n\t\t\tvar imgTablet = $(this).attr(\"img-tablet\");\r\n\t\t\tvar imgMobile = $(this).attr(\"img-mobile\");\r\n\t\t\tvar type = $(this).attr(\"img-type\");\r\n\r\n\t\t\t$(this).addClass(\"dynamic-image-\" + num);\r\n\r\n\t\t\tvar id = num;\r\n\r\n\t\t\tif(type==\"background\"){ \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t$(this).css(\"background-image\",\"url(\" + imgMobile + \")\");\r\n\r\n\t\t\t} else {\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t$(this).attr(\"src\", imgMobile);\r\n\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t//// If smaller than mobile landscape\r\n\t\t\tif(windowWidth&lt;500){\r\n\t\t\t\treturn false;\r\n\t\t\t\tclearInterval(checkForImages);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\tif(!$(\"#cacheTablet\" + id).length) $(\"body\").prepend('&lt;img id=\"cacheTablet'  + id  + '\" style=\"position: fixed; width: 0; height: 0; top: - 1000px;\" src=\"' + imgTablet + '\" /&gt;');\r\n\t\t\tif(!$(\"#cacheFull\" + id).length) $(\"body\").prepend('&lt;img id=\"cacheFull'  + id  + '\" style=\"position: fixed; width: 0; height: 0; top: - 1000px;\" src=\"' + imgFull + '\" /&gt;');\r\n\r\n\t\t\tvar checkForImages = setInterval(function(){\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tif($('#cacheTablet' + id).get(0).complete){\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tif(type==\"background\"){ \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t$(\".dynamic-image-\" + id).css(\"background-image\",\"url(\" + imgTablet + \")\");\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t} else {\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t$(\".dynamic-image-\" + id).attr(\"src\", imgTablet);\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t//// If smaller than desktop but larger than mobile\r\n\t\t\t\t\tif(windowWidth&gt;500 &amp;&amp; windowWidth&lt;770){\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclearInterval(checkForImages);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn false;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tif($('#cacheFull' + id).get(0).complete){\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tif(type==\"background\"){ \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t$(\".dynamic-image-\" + id).css(\"background-image\",\"url(\" + imgFull + \")\");\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t} else {\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t$(\".dynamic-image-\" + id).attr(\"src\", imgFull);\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tclearInterval(checkForImages);\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t}, 100);\r\n\r\n\t\t\tnum++;\r\n        });\r\n\r\n    };\r\n\r\n}( jQuery ));</pre>\r\nView a demo here:\r\n<a href=\"http://tonyspiro.com/dev/dynamic-image/\" target=\"_blank\">http://tonyspiro.com/dev/dynamic-image/</a>\r\n\r\nView on github:\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/tonyspiro/dynamic-image/\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/tonyspiro/dynamic-image/</a>","metafields":null,"type_slug":"post","created":"2015-10-04T07:42:05.579Z","user_id":"5357ef811693be2118000001","options":null,"order":24},{"_id":"5610d84dc6fe7fd67700000b","bucket":"55ee2cb5286ef99908000004","slug":"generate-a-random-string-with-php","title":"Generate a Random String With PHP","content":"This is a really useful function that generates a random string including numbers and letters both upper and lower case.
